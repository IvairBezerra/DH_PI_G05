2,HarperCollins,"Standing Firm Leaves No Doubt That Dan Quayle Is The Most Misjudged Figure In Modern Political History. Prior To 1988, Quayle Had Never Lost An Election. Not For Congress. Not Even For The Senate. Heading Into That Year's Republican Convention, Quayle Was Considered One Of The Party's Brightest Young Stars - A Man Of Unusual Political Instincts Who, When It Came To Campaigning, Had A Reputation As A Giant Killer. He Would Become The First In His Generation To Hold National Office, But Only After A Tumultuous Contest That Frequently Put Him On The Defensive. With Gritty Honesty And Admirable Self-deprecation, Quayle Describes What It Was Like To Weather That 1988 Media Storm, And The Other Squalls That Followed. Poignantly, He Also Talks Of The Self-confidence And Christian Faith That Gave Him The Courage To Stand Firm And Record Some Of The Most Noteworthy Contributions Of Any Vice President Ever. Among The High Points: His Coordination Of America's Response To A Coup Attempt In The Philippines, The Details Of Which Have Never Been Reported; His Bringing The Family-values Issue To The Fore With The Murphy Brown Speech - A Call For Action That, One Year Later, Would Even Draw Support From Democratic President Bill Clinton; His Use Of The White House Competitiveness Council To Curtail Harmful Overregulation; His Unreported Diplomacy With Latin American Leaders; And His Championing Of Legal Reform, Which Would Earn Him The Strongest Praise Of His Vice-presidency. Quayle Pulls No Punches When It Comes To Assessing Himself And Other Players In The Bush Administration - The Men And Women Who Were His Allies, And Sometimes His Opponents, In Helping George Bush Spread Democracy Around The World. He Shares Entries From His Diary Of The Persian Gulf Crisis, Offers A Surprising Snapshot Of What The Typical Bush Cabinet Meeting Was Like, Describes Intramural Battles Waged By White House Power Brokers, And Reveals His Special Relationship With The President. Quayle, A Former Journalist, Interviewed Several Members Of The Press For This Book, And Their Contributions Form A Vital Part Of Its Fabric. Standing Firm Is Perhaps Most Intriguing In Its Analysis Of What Went Wrong In The 1992 Election. Quayle Does Not Hesitate To Place Blame Where It Is Deserved - In Fact, He Reserves Some Of The Strongest Criticism For Himself. Throughout, The Portrait That Emerges Of The Former Vice President Is That Of A Man Whose Good Humor Is Exceeded Only By A Competence For Which He Has Never Been Fully Credited.

One is as familiar to us as that beloved teddy bear Winnie the Pooh. From the ""how"" of Pooh to the Tao of Pooh is a simple, effortless, joyous step...a delicious journey to Pooh Corner illuminated by the timeless teachings of the Taoist immortals.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Author/narrator Hoff calls Winnie the Pooh a ``Western Taoist'' and uses the unassuming bear to introduce Eastern philosophical principles. Pooh epitomizes the ``uncarved block,'' as he is well in tune with his natural inner self. Pooh enjoys simple pleasures and the daily progress of life. Hoff contrasts this unpretentiousness to other characters created by Winnie - the - Pooh author A.A. Milne, including Owl, whom he describes as a ``mind that tries too hard,'' and Eeyore, the eternal pessimist. In a clear and crisp voice, Hoff explains the central tenets of Taoism and further illustrates them with familiar excerpts from The House at Pooh Corner stories (1923), Chinese proverbs, maxims, and tales from Lao Tzu and others. The result is at once thought-provoking and charming. This is a small literary event that will leave all who experience it a little more serene. For most collections.-- Jeanne P.

29,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"<p>A first novel of startling scope and ambition, <b>Prague</b> depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune financial, romantic, and spiritual in an exotic city newly opened to the West.</p><h3>Book Magazine</h3><p>Prague is one of the best first novels I've read in several years. It is also one of the most challenging, for Arthur Phillips reworks the nineteenth-century international novel, the setting-saturated, character-centered, slow-moving form practiced by Henry James. Readers used to the action-oriented plots that drive much of the contemporary fiction about Americans abroad will need to adjust to the more complex and more subtle intertwining of stories that Phillips presents. Like the old and beautiful city for which the novel is named, Prague requires and rewards leisurely exploration. <BR> <BR> Prague opens in Budapest in May 1990. Five North Americans in their mid- to late twenties sit in a cafe and play Sincerity, a game in which each participant makes five statements others have to judge as true or false. What the characters state about themselves and how they respond to their friends set up an immediately interesting dynamic that Phillips complicates and then extends by bringing other people into the initial group. ""Somehow this one game of Sincerity becomes the distilled recollection of a much longer series of events,"" Phillips writes. ""It persistently rises to the surface of your memory&#151;that afternoon when you fell in love with a person or a place or a mood, when you savored the power of fooling everyone, when you discovered some great truth about the world."" <BR> <BR> Charles Gabor, master of Sincerity and insincerity, is a Hungarian-American venture capitalist bottom-feeding in the newly open economy. Mark Payton, who recently earned a doctorate in cultural studies, is passionately committed to his scholarly analysis of nostalgia in different cultures. Emily Oliver, alow-level employee at the American Embassy, says she's incapable of lying. Scott Price, a California health faddist teaching English, is a master of irony. His younger brother John, a recent arrival who becomes a columnist for the English-language newspaper, is Phillips' focal character, a person who oscillates between sincerity and insincerity. <BR> <BR> In this novel about the search for authenticity, all five of the main characters have secret desires that move them and the book forward. Charles plots the takeover of a small Hungarian publisher for himself, not for his firm. Mark pursues other men. The wholesome Nebraska-bred Emily has a lesbian liaison. And always-flippant Scott turns out to be seriously engaged with a Hungarian woman. <BR> <BR> John Price is more complicated. Although he moons over Emily, he has sex with several other women, including his brother's girlfriend. John follows Mark's lead in studying old Budapest, yet helps Charles plot against the hoary publisher who symbolizes the city's history. Toward the end, the business takeover provides some conventional suspense; but the characters' changing responses to one another and to a closely observed setting are the author's primary interests and, in turn, become the reader's. <BR> <BR> Phillips has said he suffers from ""hyperglycemic nostalgia,"" and Prague longs for the ""seriousness""&#151;a key word in the book&#151;of nineteenth-century fiction. Phillips narrates the story omnisciently and persistently, usually choosing indirect discourse over dialogue. The effect is authorial high seriousness, but with a touch of haughty superiority. The characters don't seem to satisfy their creator, not even the ""authentic"" Hungarians, not the aged publisher Imre Horvath, not the elderly jazz pianist Nadja. Their history as victims of both Nazis and communists gives them an initial appeal that Phillips diminishes as they become self-promoting windbags, perhaps to impress the outsiders. <BR> <BR> If Budapest can't measure up to Prague (a place the characters never go), and if Phillips' characters can't measure up to his ideal of authentic living, I can say&#151;as a part-time resident of a Balkan country&#151;that Phillips gets just right the eccentricities of an expatriate community. Living at the edge of familiar European culture makes his characters intensely conscious of themselves and their friends. Most enjoy being ""exotic"" without doing anything to earn that label. English teacher Scott knows no Hungarian and takes pleasure from living outside of language. Several characters suffer from the dread ""Visiting Family Syndrome"" that takes them away from their friends. Those in the country for six months resent recent arrivals, and anyone with an apartment mocks tourists. In one of the novel's great comic moments, Charles, Mark and John give a student travel writer a mass of specious information about ""authentic"" Budapest destinations. <BR> <BR> Phillips also finds inventive ways of presenting Hungarian history that contrasts with the shallow pasts of his North American characters. The 200-year-old publishing firm, which did business with a succession of governments, represents Hungarian political life. Buildings that the characters live in or move among still have bullet marks from the 1956 ""revolution,"" and the old pianist Nadja tells stories of Hungarians who were frequently forced into exile. Phillips' characters keep saying Budapest is no Prague, but Phillips makes the city as fascinating to readers as Prague is to his characters. <BR> <BR> At 380 densely printed pages, Prague is unusually long for a first novel by an unknown writer. To do full justice to its numerous characters, it needed to be longer yet. The Americans compare themselves to the Lost Generation of Americans in Paris in the '20s, but Phillips is too serious a writer to engage in this kind of shortcut, group characterization. <BR> <BR> Although Phillips knows&#151;as a resident alien, as a novelist&#151;that authenticity is earned, he or his editor didn't allow Prague the space to fully become what it initially promised to be. But Phillips promises to be a strong new American voice, and Prague is the largest-minded first novel since Mark Z. Danielewski's audacious House of Leaves in 2000.<BR></p>",en,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/72/9780375759772.jpg,Prague: A Novel,Reprint,"Height: 8.02 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.64 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches",400.0,2003,,"['Phillips, Arthur']",Prague: A Novel,9780375759772,17,Paperback,0375759778,0375759778,,

32,W W Norton & Co Inc,"<p>Some of Ürümchi's mummies date back as far as 4,000 years—contemporary with the famous Egyptian mummies but even more beautifully preserved. Surprisingly, these prehistoric people are not Asian but Caucasoid—tall, large-nosed and blond with thick beards and round eyes. What were these blond Caucasians doing in the heart of Asia? What language did they speak? Might they be related to a ""lost tribe"" known from later inscriptions? Few clues are offered by their pottery or tools, but their <b>clothes</b>—woolens that rarely survive more than a few centuries—have been preserved as brightly hued as the day they were woven. Elizabeth Wayland Barber describes these remarkable mummies and their clothing, and deduces their path to this remote, forbidding place.

Her wide audience enjoys the warmth of her fiction, the emphasis on the power of love to transform ordinary lives even as she acknowledges that for some people, love is elusive or the prelude to frustration and heartbreak. Here she presents 15 short stories that take place during the holiday season; all display her deft rendering of family relationships and the stresses of contemporary life. Unfortunately, however, these tales are formulaic and superficial. We meet women unable to spend Christmas with their married men, children from broken homes, aged parents for whom Christmas is an ordeal rather than a pleasure, couples trying to resolve the past, lonely souls looking for a future. Several stories feature second wives whose husbands are oblivious to the machinations of their (always beautiful but selfish) first spouses. While the characters and their predicaments are potentially interesting, as soon as her narratives begin to develop, Binchy catapults forward to disappointingly simplistic endings. Readers will yearn for more: more character development, more detail, less fast-forwarding, fewer perky or maudlin conclusions. These tales are fine for a fast read during a busy season, but many will wish that Binchy had instead developed one of them into a novel that would do justice to her characters and themes.

47,Ballantine Books,"Seabiscuit was an unlikely champion: a roughhewn, undersized horse with a sad little tail and knees that wouldn't straighten all the way. But, thanks to the efforts of three men, Seabiscuit became one of the most spectacular performers in sports history. The rags-to-riches horse emerged as an American cultural icon, drawing an immense following and becoming the single biggest newsmaker of 1938 -- receiving more coverage than FDR or Hitler. Laura Hillenbrand beautifully renders this story of one horse's journey from also-ran to national luminary.

55,Three Rivers Press,"<p><P><b>The Onion</b> has quickly become the world's most popular humor publication, misinforming half a million readers a week with one-of-a-kind social satire both in print (on newsstands nationwide) and online from its remote office in Madison, Wisconsin.<P>Witness the march of history as Editor-in-Chief Scott Dikkers and <b>The Onion's</b> award-winning writing staff present the twentieth century like you've never seen it before.</p> <h3>Salon - Liesl Schillinger</h3> <p><P>Nobody loves the last word more than a newsman -- and now that the 20th century is in its final stretch, the green-shade jockeys are neck and neck in the sum-up-the-century steeplechase. Walter Cronkite, Ben Bradlee and David Brinkley leapt in early with their books, and last year Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Harold Evans made impressive late entries. This month, though, Scott Dikkers and his madcap crew of angry young hacks at the <i>Onion</i>, the satirical weekly paper and Web site based in Madison, Wis., have sent the competition to the glue factory with their definitively victorious wrap-up, <i>Our Dumb Century</i>. Other reporters may have given the century a solemn salute, but the <i>Onion</i>'s staff has given it a resounding Bronx cheer, and early sales show that the public heartily approves of their assessment. <P>It is an unimaginably gloat-worthy luxury for a humorist to invade the virgin territory of American news coverage in the pre-irony era, and Dikkers and his henchmen make no attempt to muffle their glee. In a year-by-year parade of phony front pages, the editors goose-step through the 20th century, snickering at catastrophes, making hay of the news and booting one another in the rear along the way. The new century dawns with progress-drunk headlines blaring ""Nation's Skies Filled with Beautiful Black Smoke,"" while the birth of the bomb 40-odd years later prompts the blithe, whistling denial ""Nothing Going on in New Mexico: Top Physicists 'Just Camping.'"" By the time the television age has hit full flicker, no topic is off-limits -- from breasts (""President Calls for Calm Following Nipple Sighting on Farrah Fawcett Poster"") to shootings (""Hinckley, Foster to Wed: Actress 'Very Impressed' by Lone-Nut Gunman's Attempt on President's Life"") to air disasters (""Schoolteacher, Kitten, Three Dozen Orphans to Fly on Challenger Tomorrow""). <P>As the book careers through the decades, no subject, however grave, however innocent, is left unstrafed. World War II offers the occasion for ""Hitler Neutralizes Polish Menace"" and ""Belgium Hides."" Later wars in Southeast Asia provide such notable gasps as ""Cambodia to Switch to Skull-Based Economy"" and ""U.S. Troops Pull Out of Vietnamese Peasant Girl."" The shockfest winds up with signs that the ""swell years"" have long since gone and a cynical American populace has come to expect political scandal, nuclear fallout, lubricious mothers and despoiled nature -- even if the president who will lead us all into our next dumb century, Bill Clinton, vows that he ""Feels Nation's Pain, Breasts."" <P>""It's actually hard to write satire now,"" the <i>Onion</i> editors have said, ""... because the news is already a parody of itself."" On the last front page in <i>Our Dumb Century</i>, the <i>Onion</i> reports the scoop that will make headlines on January 1, 2000 -- the day all the people who have stashed cash under their beds will take up arms against all the paupers with digital bank accounts: ""Christian Right Ascends to Heaven.""

61,Random House,"Pirates have become so much a part of story and legend that is easy to forget they actually existed in the flesh. Their roving lives left behind little in the way of historical record; thus our image of them is derived from a smattering of fact overlaid with three centuries of ballads, plays, epic poems, and films. But how does our conception of pirates compare with the reality, and why has such a romantic aura become associated with murderers and thieves? Pursuing that question, Dr. David Cordingly, former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum, has mined a wealth of original sources - eyewitness accounts, court documents, national archives, and more - to create the most authoritative and definitive account of the great age of piracy since the 1724 bestseller The General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates. Under the Black Flag explodes many closely held myths and replaces them with a truth that is more complex and every bit as fascinating. Here are the real stories of Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Henry Morgan, along with lesser-known but equally noteworthy pirates such as Henry Avery (who captured an emperor's treasure fleet but died penniless) and the cross-dressing women Anne Bonny and Mary Read. From the havoc of battle to the isolation of life at sea, Under the Black Flag makes tangible the day-to-day existence of pirates. How they attacked, how they governed themselves, what they wore, what ships they used, why they flourished in the years around 1720, and what brought their reign of terror to an end - all is revealed in this rousing and revisionist history.

                        <p>For this rousing, revisionist history, the former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum has combed original documents and records to produce a most authoritative and definitive account of piracy's ""Golden Age."" As he explodes many accepted myths (i.e. ""walking the plank"" is pure fiction), Cordingly replaces them with a truth that is more complex and often bloodier. of photos. Maps.
